# <p align="center">My personal portfolio site</p>

> This is the second version of my portfolio site. It is part of something new I started, called The Annual Refresh. 

## What is Annual Refresh?
Annual refresh is a yearly event that I started last year. It's main aim is to practice what I've learnt so far throughout the year.
Basically, it's more like a portfolio redesign, where I change the structure of my portfolio and implement new features, more technologies and my personal favorite, animations.

## Why did I start?
<ol>
   <li>I get tired of one design on my portfolio because after some time, I find more features I should have added.</li>
   <li>I get the chance to implement various ideas I've come across on the web</li>
   <li>Technologies change, and my portfolio has to prove I'm picking these new technologies on the way</li>
</ol>

We're barely a month into 2022, my portfolio isn't 3months old yet, and ideas have already started to invade my head.

Now you're also thinking... Your portfolio could use a redesign next year right?
I'd love you to join me, so we can brainstorm these ideas together.

Send me a mail: treasureajefu@gmail.com with The Annual Refresh as the title.
